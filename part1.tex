\subsection*{Creating your own Features}

You can design your own Feature and have it approved by your Referee.

Combat-related features usually roll twice for HP taking the better result.

The usual Feature benefit could be:
\begin{itemize}
	\item bonus Damage die for some condition (for Advancement start with d4 and increase by one)
	\item additional effect for character's attacks
	\item Advantage on some specific set of Saves
	\item special trick.
\end{itemize}

Try to balance new Features with the existing ones.
