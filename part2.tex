\section{Rules}
\index{Rules}
\index{Referee}

\paragraph{Saves}
\index{Saves}
Roll d20 equal or under the appropriate Ability Score to succeed. 1 is always a success and 20 always a failure.

\paragraph{Advantage and Disadvantage}
\index{Advantage}
\index{Disadvantage}
Whenever someone has increased or decreased odds of succeeding on a Save, the Referee may give them Advantage or Disadvantage. Roll twice and take the better or worse of the two rolls respectively. Advantage and Disadvantage cancel each other out.

\paragraph{Taking your Turn}
\index{Combat!turns}
\index{Turns|see {Combat, turns}}
In a combat situation the Referee decides which side acts first. When this is unclear, player characters must pass \saves{DEX} to be able to act before their opponents. After such initial turn all player characters act together as usual.

On their turn characters can generally move and carry out one action. All characters declare their intentions and after that the dice are rolled.

\paragraph{Attacking}
\index{Attacks}
\index{Damage}
\index{Damage!bonus}
\index{Bonus Damage|see {Damage, bonus}}
Roll your weapon's Damage die, or for both weapons if wielding two, along with any bonus Damage dice you have. The highest single roll is identified, and the attack causes this much damage.

Ranged weapons cannot be used while engaged in melee combat.

\paragraph{Ganging Up}
\index{Ganging Up}
When multiple attackers target an individual, they roll together and keep the highest result, plus 1 damage for each additional attacker, up to +5. Once the attack has been resolved, the target cannot be attacked again until their next turn.

\begin{dbox}
\paragraph{Ganging Up: Easy Mode (optional)}
For a more ``cinematic'' combat feel, you may forgo bonus damage from additional attackers.
\end{dbox}

\paragraph{Impaired and Enhanced Attacks}
\index{Attacks!impaired}
\index{Impaired Attacks|see {Attacks, impaired}}
Attacks that are Impaired, such as firing through cover or a resistant target, roll d4 Damage regardless of weapon, no bonus Damage dice allowed.

\index{Attacks!enhanced}
\index{Enhanced Attacks|see {Attacks, enhanced}}
Attacks that are Enhanced by a risky stunt or a vulnerable target gain bonus d12 Damage die.

\paragraph{Manoeuvres}
\index{Manoeuvres}
In place of making a normal attack you may spend your turn trying to carry out another manoeuvre, such as knocking an opponent down, snatching an item or fleeing. In these cases the side most at risk makes a Save to avoid consequences.

\paragraph{Armour}
\index{Armour}
Armour subtracts its score from result of any Damage rolls against the wearer.

Total Armour score for a creature cannot exceed 3.

\paragraph{Mounted Combat}
\index{Combat!mounted}
\index{Mounted Combat|see {Combat, mounted}}
Mounted combatants gain +1 Armour and bonus weapon Damage die.

\paragraph{Damage}
\index{Damage}
\index{Hit Points}
When taking damage you lose that many Hit Points. If you have any HP left, then the attack was mostly avoided or only a minor wound was inflicted.

When you run out of HP, any remaining Damage is removed from your STR score. Now you must pass a \save{STR} to avoid Critical Damage.

\paragraph{Blast Damage}
\index{Damage!blast}
\index{Blast Damage|see {Damage, blast}}
Blast attacks affect all targets in the appropriate area, rolling once for each target. If unsure how many targets are affected, roll Damage die.

\paragraph{Critical Damage}
\index{Damage!critical}
\index{Critical Damage|see {Damage, critical}}
Characters that take Critical Damage are unable to take further action until they are tended to by an ally and have a Rest. If they are left untended to for an hour, they die.

\paragraph{Ability Score Loss}
\index{Ability Score Loss}
\index{Healing}
The character dies at STR~0. At DEX~0 or WIL~0 the character is paralysed or catatonic respectively, cannot act until Healing and must be carried to safety.

\paragraph{Death}
\index{Death}
When a character dies the player creates a new character and the Referee finds a way to have them join the group as soon as possible. Alternatively the player may take control of a Hireling or Apprentice.

\paragraph{Morale}
\index{Morale}
The leader of a group must pass a \save{WIL} to avoid their group being routed when they lose half of their total numbers. Lone combatants must pass this Save when they are reduced to 0hp. This applies to opponents and allies but not player characters.

\paragraph{Retreat}
\index{Retreat}
Fleeing to safety under pursuit requires a \save{DEX} and somewhere to run to.

\paragraph{Rest}
\index{Rest}
A few minutes of rest and a swig of water recovers all of character's lost Hit Points. Resting may waste time or attract danger.

\paragraph{Healing}
\index{Healing}
Ability Score Loss and other serious ailments require the aid of an Expert service or magic to recover.

\paragraph{Assumed Ability Scores}
\index{Ability Scores!assumed}
Any Ability Score not listed is treated as 10.

\paragraph{Reaction}
\index{Reaction}
When a reaction to a character is uncertain, pass a \save{WIL} to avoid a negative reaction.

\paragraphsection{Conditions:}
\index{Conditions}

\index{Blinded|see {Conditions}}
\subparagraph{Blinded} creatures may require a \save{DEX} to carry out actions that rely on sight, their attacks are Impaired, and \saves{DEX} are rolled at Disadvantage.

\index{Hidden|see {Conditions}}
\subparagraph{Hidden} creature's attacks are Enhanced, but any attack or other similar action unveils the attacker.

\index{Invisible|see {Conditions}}
\subparagraph{Invisible} creature's attacks are Enhanced, attacks targeted at invisible creatures are Impaired.

\index{Stunned|see {Conditions}}
