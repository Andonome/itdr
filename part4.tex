\index{Tome}
Written in Runic and found in Tomes and Scrolls. Spells require a few minutes of uninterrupted calm and attention to cast, as well as requiring a set of detailed gestures and incantations. Consequently, Spells are generally impossible to cast in combat.

Mystics can cast any spell of a Circle \textbf{equal or lower} to their Mystic Level.

\index{Spells!ongoing effects}
\subparagraph{Ongoing effects} last until you cast another Spell.

\index{Spells!persistent}
\index{Persistent Spells|see {Spells, persistent}}
\subparagraph{Persistent Spells} have their effects last as long as you wish or until you cast the same spell again.

\index{Spells!cantrips}
\index{Cantrips|see {Spells, cantrips}}
\subparagraph{Cantrips}
These minor tricks are not true spells, do not interrupt ongoing effects of the previous spell, and require you to use your Focus to cast them.

\vfill
\index{Focus}
\paragraph{Focus}
Every Mystic carries a Focus, typically an orb, wand, or staff that allows to instantly cast a Prepared Spell or any Cantrip you know as an action, while performing the proper gestures and incantations.

\index{Spells!dispel}
\index{Dispel|see {Spells, dispel}}
It can also be used to \textbf{dispel} the ongoing effect of another Mystic's Spell unless they pass a \save{WIL}.

A Focus does not work when wearing armour.

\vfill
\index{Spells!prepared}
\index{Prepared Spells|see {Spells, prepared}}
\paragraph{Prepared Spells}
During the Rest you can use your Tome to prepare a number of spells equal to your Experience Level to cast using your Focus as an action.

Casting a Prepared Spell causes Damage equal to its Spell Circle~$\times$~2 \textbf{to the caster} ignoring Armour. At 0hp, this Damage targets WIL instead of STR: pass a \save{WIL} or fall unconscious for a few minutes.

\vfill
\index{Spells!signature}
\index{Signature Spells|see {Spells, signature}}
\paragraph{Signature Spells}
Each time you take Mystic Feature, choose a new Signature spell to cast without preparation and at half its cost (1hp per Spell Circle).\\
\begin{dbox}
	Scrolls of new spells found by Mystics are usually attached to the Tome for the convenience of usage.
	
	See \textbf{Manufacture of Magic Equipment} in \mbox{\textbf{Appendix A}} for the additional information on creation of Focuses and Scrolls.
