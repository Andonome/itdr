\index{Tome}
Written in Runic and found in Tomes and Scrolls. Spells require a few minutes of uninterrupted calm and attention to cast, as well as requiring a set of detailed gestures and incantations. Consequently, Spells are generally impossible to cast in a combat.

\index{Spells!ongoing effects}
\subparagraph{Ongoing effects} last until you cast another Spell.

\index{Spells!persistent}
\index{Persistent Spells|see {Spells, persistent}}
\subparagraph{Persistent Spells} have their effects last as long as you wish or until you cast the same spell again.

\index{Spells!cantrips}
\index{Cantrips|see {Spells, cantrips}}
\subparagraph{Cantrips}
These minor tricks are not true spells and require you to use your Focus to cast them.

\index{Focus}
\paragraph{Focus}
Every Mystic carries a Focus, typically an orb, wand or staff that allows to instantly cast a Prepared Spell or any Cantrip you know as an action, while performing the proper gestures and incantations.

\index{Spells!dispel}
\index{Dispel|see {Spells, dispel}}
It can also be used to dispel the ongoing effect of another Mystic's Spell unless they pass a \save{WIL}.

A Focus doesn't work if you are wearing Armour.

\index{Spells!prepared}
\index{Prepared Spells|see {Spells, prepared}}
\paragraph{Prepared Spells}
During the Rest you can use your Tome to prepare a number of spells equal to your Experience Level to cast using your Focus as an action.

The Spell cast this way deals Damage equal to its Spell Circle~$\times$~2 to the caster ignoring Armour. At 0hp this Damage targets WIL instead of STR.

\begin{dbox}
\index{Spells!speed casting}
\index{Speed Casting|see {Spells, speed casting}}
\paragraph{Speed Casting (optional, in place of Prepared Spells)}
%{\slshape Use this option in place of Prepared Spells rule.}

Your focus allows you to cast any Spell you know in a number of combat rounds equal to its Circle~+~1. To speed it up, take 2hp Damage ignoring Armour per each round of reduced cast time. This Damage occurs when the spell is cast, and at 0hp it targets WIL instead of STR.
\end{dbox}

\index{Spells!signature}
\index{Signature Spells|see {Spells, signature}}
\paragraph{Signature Spells}
Each time you take Mystic Feature, choose a Signature spell to cast without preparation and at half its cost (1hp per Spell Circle).
