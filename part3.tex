\chapter{Ruling a Domain}
\index{Domains}

Any community of 100 or more people is a Domain. One or more characters may have rulership of a Domain, with the potential to establish a part of the world as their own.

\section{Size Scores and Population}
\index{Size Score}
\index{SIZ|see {Size Score}}
\index{Population}

Size Score, or SIZ, is a measure of the populace of your Domain and may reach a maximum of 20.

\begin{dtable}[LrLLr]
	\textbf{SIZ} & \textbf{Populace} && \textbf{SIZ} & \textbf{Populace} \\
	1  & 100	&& 11 & 30,000	\\
	2  & 300	&& 12 & 50,000	\\
	3  & 600	&& 13 & 75,000	\\
	4  & 1,000	&& 14 & 100,000\\
	5  & 3,000	&& 15 & 150,000\\
	6  & 5,000	&& 16 & 200,000\\
	7  & 7,500	&& 17 & 300,000\\
	8  & 10,000	&& 18 & 500,000	\\
	9  & 15,000	&& 19 & 750,000	\\
	10 & 20,000	&& 20 & 1,000,000	\\
\end{dtable}

Each month, you must choose a focus for your \mbox{Domain} from the following.

\subparagraph{Taxation:} You gather extra money this month, gaining 1s for each of your populace.

\subparagraph{Growth:} Roll d20. If this is higher than your SIZ, then your SIZ is increased by 1.

\subparagraph{Prosperity:} You do not need to roll to see if there is Unrest in your Domain this month.

\paragraph{Civil Unrest}
At the end of the month, roll d20. If this is equal or lower than your SIZ, there is Unrest in your Domain. 10\% of your population revolts and must be quashed or else they seize control of your Domain.

\index{Soldiers}
\subparagraph{Training Soldiers:} 20\% of populace are fit for calling into service as poorly skilled conscripts (3hp). A further 1\% of your population are professional soldiers (STR~12, 5hp, Novice Warrior). All soldiers must be equipped as required.

\subparagraph{Large Battles:} When handling large numbers of combatants, they should be massed together as a unit. Units have the same Hit Points as a single combatant, but add 1 damage for how many times to one they outnumber their opponents. E.g., a unit of 200 cavemen fighting 50 spearmen outnumber them \mbox{5-to-1}, gaining 5 bonus damage.

When units take Critical Damage, their numbers are halved and they must pass a \save{WIL} or break and disband. At STR~0 they are wiped out.

Individual attacks against units are Impaired, unless they cause Blast damage.

Unit attacks against individuals are Enhanced and cause Blast damage.

\index{Sieges}
\index{Walls}
\index{Structures}
\subparagraph{Sieges:} Wooden walls have 6hp, Armour~6, and stone walls have 8hp, Armour~8. Reducing a wall to 0hp allows passage over it. Walls and other defensive structures usually ignore damage from anything but siege engines and such.

\index{Siege Engines}
\subparagraph{Siege Engines:} Cannons and the like cause d12 Blast Damage.
